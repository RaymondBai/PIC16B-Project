# PIC16B-Project

## Project proposal

### The Big Picture
It’s around this stage that it’s very natural to ask:

What makes a good project?

The Required Sections of the project proposal, as well as the overall Project Description will tell you a lot about what I’m looking for. That said, there are two simple questions that you should ask yourselves when envisioning your project:

Will I learn something by completing this project?
Will I be proud of this project once it’s done?

If the answer to both questions is “yes,” then your overall project idea is likely good. Feel free to approach me early if you want to talk over whether your project idea is suitable for the course.

### Abstract
In 3-4 sentences, describe what problem the project addresses, and the overall approach you will use to solve that problem. Include a link to the git repo that you created in Part 1.

### Planned Deliverables
Concisely state what you are aiming to create and what capabilities it will have. Are you making a webapp? A Python package for others to use? Code that creates a novel data set? Etc. Please consider two scenarios:

“Full success.” What will your deliverable be if everything works out for you exactly as you plan?
“Partial success.” What useful deliverable will you be able to offer even if things don’t 100% work out? For example, maybe you aren’t able to get that webapp together, but you can still create a code repository that showcases the machine learning pipeline needed to use to support the app. Have a contingency plan!
 

### Resources Required
What resources do you need in order to complete your project? Data? Computing power? An account with a specific service?

Please pay special attention to the question of data. If your project idea involves data, include at least one link to a data set you can use. It’s also acceptable to link to a website from which you intend to scrape the data you will use (although note that high-quality scraping is a lot of work).

If you can’t find data for your original idea, that’s ok! Think of something related to your group’s interests for which you can find data.

Most projects should involve data in some way, but certain projects may not require data. Ask me if you’re not sure.

### Tools and Skills Required
What skills will you need? Machine learning, database management, complex visualization, something else? Do a bit of research into which Python packages accomplish the tasks you are going to need. Feel free to look ahead at what we’re going to do in the remainder of the course – you’re likely to find some of the packages you’ll need there!

### What You Will Learn
What will each of you learn by completing this project? Please write at least one leaarning goal per person. Feel free to mention particular techniques, software packages, version control, project management principles, any other learning goals you might have.

### Risks
What are two things that could potentially stop you from achieving the full deliverable above? Maybe it turns out that the signal you thought would be present in the data just doesn’t exist? Or maybe your idea requires more computational power than is available to you? What particular risks might be applicable for your project?

### Ethics
All projects we undertake involve decisions about whose interests matter; which problems are important; and which tradeoffs are considered acceptable. Take some time to reflect on the potential impacts of your product on its users and the broader world. If you can see potential biases or harms from your work, describe some of the ways in which you will work to mitigate them. Remember that even relatively simple ideas can have unexpected and impactful biases.
